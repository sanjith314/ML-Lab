In this assignment, we use the $n$-fold cross validation method to perform cross validation. In $n$-fold cross validation, we evenly partition the dataset into $n$ mutually disjoint subsets (a.k.a. _folds_). We train an ML model on all but one subset (i.e., train on the union of $n-1$ folds), and then evaluate the model on the subset that was left out.  The former is called _training subset_, while the latter is called _validation subset_. This process is repeated $n$ times, with a different subset reserved for evaluation (and excluded from training) each time. If the size of the dataset is not exactly divisible by $n$, the remainder can be arbitrarily distributed into the folds.\n",

        "To specify, we will vary $k$ in the range (1, 100) in increments of 1.\n",

Now in the current setting, (X_strain, Y_train) loaded above correspond to the _dataset_. In other words, this Section 3.1 will **not** use the test examples loaded above."
