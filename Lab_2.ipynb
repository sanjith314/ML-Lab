See the last four lines of the following code block, which lie outside the definition of `my_euclidean_dist`.  You can uncomment them for testing, but comment them back when you finish the entire lab.\n",

After executing all commands and completing this notebook, save your `Lab_2.ipynb` as a PDF file, named as `X_Y_UIN.pdf`, where `X` is your first name, `Y` is your last name, and `UIN` is your UIN. Make sure that your PDF file includes all parts of your solution, including the plots.\n",
