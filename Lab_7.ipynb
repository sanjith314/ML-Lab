        "In our previous lab assignment, we have learned how to use linear regression to predict the quality of wines. Actually linear regression is one of the most extensively used statistical technique for predictive modelling analysis thanks to its simplicity. Let us take a quick review of this method.\n",

        "### 1.1 Recap of linear regression {-}\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression assumes that the dependence of the target $y$ on the features $x_1, ..., x_m$ is linear, even if the true regression function is nonlinear. One benefit of making a linear dependence assumption is that the relationship between the target and features can be easily interpreted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's define $f_w(x)$ as the hypothesis for $y$ as a function of $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$, under the weight vector $w\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$.  This results in the following prediction function:\n",
        "$$f_w(x) = x^Tw.$$\n",
        "Our goal is to find the optimal $w$ that maps $f_w(x)$ to $y$ as accurately as possible. To achieve that, we use gradient descent to minimize the squared loss as the cost function:\n",
        "$$L(w) = \\frac{1}{2}||x^Tw - y||^2.$$\n",
        "Once we have learned the optimal $w$ from training data, we can use the learned model to predict the real value for test examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, linear regression is predicting continuous variables instead of binary variables. Then a natural question is whether linear regression can be used to solve classification problems. The answer is affirmative. Considering a binary classification problem, one can set up a threshold to distinguish different categories. Say if the predicted continuous value is greater than the threshold value, the data point will be classified as positive. Otherwise, it will be classified as negative. However, these predictions are not sensible for classification because the predicted values range from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ which can lead to adverse consequences in real-time. As a result, logistic regression comes to play.\n",

Each example is a $8\\times 8$ matrix (image) where each element is an integer in the range $[0,16]$. Let's load the dataset by using the off-the-shell method from `sklearn` and print out some images to get a good understanding of the dataset."

        "Now after all the pre-processing, we can train a logisitic regression model with the training data.  It is quite straightforward to make predictions on test data by using the learned model. To simplify the task, when the probability of being positive is greater than 0.5, we classify the sample to 1. Otherwise, we classify it to 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part, we will train the model with gradient descent. After that, predict the label for test examples and compute the test accuracy. You may want to follow the procedures below to obtain the results:\n",
        "+ Randomly initialize the parameter $w$ by `np.random.rand`.\n",
        "+ Use gradient descent to update $w$ (number of iteration `num_iters` and learning rate `lr` are provided).\n",
        "+ Plot the curve of the $\\ell(w)$ value as a function of how many update steps have been taken (you need a variable to store the history of $\\ell(w)$ values).\n",
        "+ Compute and report the test accuracy on test set."

Compared with binary classification, the procedure of doing 10-ways classification is pretty much the same. Hence, in the following code block, you will need to train a MLR model and test it on test data.\n",
