        "Naive Bayes classification is a fast and simple classification method. Its efficiency stems from some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the conditional independence of features. Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n",

        "To make it more concrete, let us consider the SMS message classification problem. Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$.\n",
